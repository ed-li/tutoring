# Why I care?
Throughout my various academic and professional pursuits, I've noticed one constant between all of them is that I garner the most satisfaction through leading others to understanding new concepts. Whether the topic at hand is something ingrained in me for as long as I can remember or something new that my colleagues and I only just encountered, I almost always try to come up with additional approaches to understanding it, separate from what originally led me to my understanding. I also truly appreciate the unique thought processes that different individuals may rely on, and I believe I have an exceptional ability to figure out how others think, both quickly and thoroughly. By constantly approaching problems or concepts in various ways, and by identifying and considering the preferred train of thought those around me, I am innately a lifelong tutor.
